# Brightness-temperature-of-21-cm-line-from-a-simulation
Python code which computes the brightness temperature spectrum of 21-cm line from a simulation using the optically thin medium condition.

The goal is to produce false observations which you would get using a telescope to observe this simulated cloud.

To run the code you need data cubes for density distribution of neutral hydrogen, radial velocity distribution and temperature distribution. You can choose the velocity interval
and resolution for your spectrum. There is also a possibility to include the beam and the spectral resolution of your false measurements. Also, if you are not sure about the 
optically thin medium condition, there is a possibility to verify this condition at the end of the code.

To use the code you simply need to download the $BT_21-cm.ipynb$ file and open it in some Python notebook.

Good luck!
