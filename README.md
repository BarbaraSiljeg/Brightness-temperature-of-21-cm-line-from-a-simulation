# Brightness-temperature-of-21-cm-line-from-a-simulation
Python code which computes the brightness temperature spectrum of 21-cm emission line from a numerical simulation using the optically thin medium approximation.

The goal is to produce synthetic observations of HI spectrum from a numerical simulation.

To run the code you need 3D data cubes for density distribution of neutral hydrogen, radial velocity distribution and temperature distribution. You can choose the velocity interval and resolution for your spectrum. There is also a possibility to include the beam and the spectral resolution of your synthetic measurements. Also, if you are not sure about the optically thin medium approximation, there is a possibility to verify this at the end of the code.

To use the code, you need to download the BT_21-cm.ipynb file and open it in Jupyter notebook. You might need to install the Jupyter notebook so here is the link with the instructions to do so: https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Good luck!
